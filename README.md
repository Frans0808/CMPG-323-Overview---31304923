# Branching Strategy:
GitHub Flow has the ability to support continuous integration and delivery procedures by maintaining the master code in a deployable state that is always present.

# The use of a .gitgnore file within each project:

Instructs Git which files or folders in a project to ignore.

The root directory of a project is typically where a local.gitignore file is stored. Additionally, any entries in a global.gitignore file will be disregarded across all of your Git repositories.

# Storage of credentials and sensetive information
Because GitHub is a public platform which allows a group of people to share source code which will be more simpler to steal.
